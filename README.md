# WeCare-Android-Mobile-Application
Food and clothes donation app that connects donors with charity homes.

An app that benefits society by donating food and clothes to charity homes. This app helps match restaurants and individuals with leftover food and clothes with charities in need. Donations are collected from user’s location on their convenient hours. Volunteers can use the app to deliver the food or clothes to charities according to their schedule.
It would be very convenient and helpful if donations can be made on few clicks of their android phones and items will be collected at their doorsteps at their convenient hours. 12% of Americans are food insecure and don’t know where their next meal is coming from. Through the "WeCare" app donating food or clothes to charities has never been easier.
This app provides many functionalities. A list of all the parties and their respective locations associated with the app is provided. The participating donors and charity homes are categorized under a spinner. When the respective item is clicked, for e.g. restaurants, all the participating restaurants along with a location pin will be displayed.
For donors, you download the app, you can select the food and clothes you want to donate, the charity you want to donate to, your address and a convenient time you want the volunteer to come by. You push the “Save” button, then the selected charity home is notified of your donation. A “goodwill” points system for individuals and restaurants can be managed so that restaurants can be benefited by this app which are willing to donate extra food.
Charity homes benefit from this app as it helps them to systematically keep track of donors and total items collected in particular time duration. The Charity home which has been selected has access to a volunteer schedule and it can select the volunteer depending on his availability and notifies a volunteer of the pickup scheduled. It’s that easy.
